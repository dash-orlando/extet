# EXTET

This repository is dedicated to linking Houdini with TetGen

## Why using an external tetrahedralization method?
Houdini offers very effecient tetrahedralization tools for FEA-based simulations, but lack some of the features of research-grade volumetric mesher like TetGen

> NOTE: Other open-source meshers could be used, but we are just more familiar with TetGen
